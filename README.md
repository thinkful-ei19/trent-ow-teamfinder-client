# Overwatch Team Finder
## A collection of players showcasing their strengths to find complementary teammates. 



The main goal of Overwatch Team finder is to create a small community of players to make it easy to find players of similar skill levels to form a well rounded team of different roles.  


## The Minimum Viable Product:

* Site connects to MongoDB to maintain collection of 'players'
* Players will contain:
  * username (should be their battleNet username)
  * password
  * skill rating
  * roles 
  * hero pool
* Player cards will be generated for each profile displaying username, roles, and skill rating
* Expanded view player cards will display on click to show all info including hero pool, and extension info 



##  Reasonable Extensions of MVP

* User Authentication for people who have already made an account
* An Account tab to allow users to edit their information or delete their account
* A messaging system to allow users to contact other players
* Players are filtered by role and sorted by skill rating.


## Ambitious Extensions of MVP

* OAuth through Blizzard (also adding google login)
* Build in app forgot password link
* Dividing players amongst different regions
* A reputation system amongst players
* Adding a teams tab, to allow users to create a team card and allow other players to send a request to join
* Using a webscraper to grab a players Skill rating that would be dynamic
